### If you're encountering the "8080 already in use" error when running a Spring Boot application for the second time, it means the previous instance of the application hasn't released the port, and the operating system still considers it in use. Here's how to resolve it:

## 1. Kill the Existing Process Using Port 8080
On Windows:

#### Open Command Prompt and type the following command to find the process ID (PID) using port 8080:

```bash

netstat -ano | findstr :8080
```
#### Note the PID (Process ID) from the result.
Kill the process using:
```bash

taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

This code is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates the use of dependency injection and the basic structure of a Spring Boot project. Let's break it down:

# 1. Hello class (Component)
```java
Copy code
package Nidhi.com.example.SpringDemo;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class Hello {
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello World, Welcome to Nidhi's first Spring project");
    }
}
```
#### @Component Annotation: This is a Spring annotation that marks the Hello class as a Spring-managed bean. When the application starts, Spring will automatically detect this class and manage its lifecycle.

#### greet() method: This method prints a greeting message to the console. It's a simple method to demonstrate that the bean is working correctly.

# 2. SpringDemoApplication class (Main Application)
```java
Copy code
package Nidhi.com.example.SpringDemo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringDemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(SpringDemoApplication.class, args);
        Hello obj = context.getBean(Hello.class);
        obj.greet();
    }
}
```
#### @SpringBootApplication Annotation: This is a convenience annotation that combines several Spring annotations:

#### @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to auto-configure the application.

#### @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to scan for components (like @Component, @Service, etc.) in the package where the application is located.

#### @Configuration: Indicates that this class provides Spring configuration.

#### SpringApplication.run(): This line boots up the Spring application. It initializes the Spring context and sets up the application.

### ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(SpringDemoApplication.class, args);: 

This starts the Spring Boot application and creates an ApplicationContext (a container for managing Spring beans).

### Hello obj = context.getBean(Hello.class);: This retrieves the Hello bean from the application context. By calling getBean(), Spring injects the Hello object into the obj variable.

obj.greet();: Finally, the greet() method is called on the Hello bean, printing the message to the console.

### Explanation of the Flow:
The Spring Boot application starts with the SpringDemoApplication class.

The ApplicationContext is created, and Spring Boot automatically scans for components like the Hello class (because of the @Component annotation).

The Hello bean is retrieved from the application context using context.getBean(Hello.class).

The greet() method is called on the Hello bean, printing a greeting message to the console.

## What's missing:

To make it a proper REST service, you would typically annotate the Hello class with @RestController and expose the greet() method as a REST endpoint, but as of now, itâ€™s just a simple console-based greeting application.
