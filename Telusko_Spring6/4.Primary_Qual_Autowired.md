# Autowired, Primary, and Qualifier in Spring Framework

In Spring Framework, `@Autowired`, `@Primary`, and `@Qualifier` are annotations used for dependency injection and managing beans.

## 1. `@Autowired`
- **Purpose:** The `@Autowired` annotation is used to automatically wire beans into a Spring-managed class. Spring will automatically inject the dependency of the bean into the class that is annotated with `@Autowired`.
- **Usage:**
  - You can use `@Autowired` on a constructor, field, or setter method.
  - If the bean is not found, Spring will throw an exception (unless `@Autowired(required=false)` is used).
  
### Example:
```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired  // Constructor-based injection
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
## 2. @Primary
**Purpose**: When there are multiple beans of the same type, @Primary is used to indicate which bean should be injected when there is ambiguity.

**Usage**: You annotate one of the beans with @Primary to mark it as the default bean for autowiring.
### Example:
```java
Copy code
@Component
@Primary  // Marks this bean as the default choice
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    // Implementation
}

@Component
public class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    // Implementation
}

@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;  // DieselEngine will be injected by default
    }
}
```
## 3. @Qualifier
**Purpose**: When you have multiple beans of the same type and you don't want to use @Primary, you can use @Qualifier to specify which bean should be injected by name.

**Usage**: You annotate the injection point (field, constructor, or setter) with @Qualifier and provide the name of the bean to be injected.
### Example:
```java
Copy code
@Component("dieselEngine")
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    // Implementation
}

@Component("electricEngine")
public class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    // Implementation
}

@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("electricEngine")  // Specifies which bean to inject
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
### Key Differences:
**@Autowired**: Automatically injects a bean if it matches the required type.

**@Primary**: Used to indicate the default bean to be injected when there are multiple beans of the same type.

**@Qualifier**: Used to specify which bean to inject when there are multiple beans of the same type.
